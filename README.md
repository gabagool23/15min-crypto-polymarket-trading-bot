# 15min Crypto Polymarket Trading Bot

Automated strategy bot for [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) binary markets (e.g. 15-minute BTC price resolution). Detects short-term “dump” moves, enters **Leg 1**, then hedges with **Leg 2** when the combined cost is below a target sum to lock in edge.

## Strategy Overview

The bot runs a **two-leg** flow per round:

1. **Watching (Leg 1 window)**  
   During a configurable time window after round start, it watches UP and DOWN (or YES/NO) prices. If either side **dumps** by at least a threshold (e.g. 15%) compared to a few seconds ago, it buys that side (Leg 1).

2. **Leg 2 (hedge)**  
   After Leg 1 is filled, it waits until the **sum of Leg 1 entry price and the opposite side’s best ask** is ≤ a target (e.g. 0.95). It then buys the opposite side. Holding one share of each outcome pays out $1, so profit per share = `1.0 - (leg1_price + leg2_price)`.

3. **Done**  
   Cycle completes; in production you’d typically reset or advance to the next market/round.

Key parameters (see [Configuration](#configuration)):

- **Move %** — minimum drop (e.g. 0.15 = 15%) to trigger Leg 1.
- **Sum target** — maximum allowed sum of Leg 1 price + opposite price to trigger Leg 2 (e.g. 0.95).
- **Window** — how long after round start Leg 1 is allowed (e.g. 5 minutes).

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** toolchain (stable): [rustup](https://rustup.rs)  
  ```bash
  rustup default stable
  ```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/baker42757/15min-crypto-polymarket-trading-bot.git
cd 15min-crypto-polymarket-trading-bot

# Build
cargo build --release

# Run simulation (mock exchange, no real orders)
cargo run --release
```

The default run uses a **mock exchange**: prices and time are simulated in code so you can see the strategy logic without connecting to Polymarket.

---

## Configuration

Strategy and system settings live in code (see `src/config.rs`). Defaults:

| Parameter       | Default   | Description                                  |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `shares`       | 20.0      | Position size per leg                        |
| `sum_target`   | 0.95      | Hedge when entry + opposite price ≤ this     |
| `move_pct`     | 0.15      | Leg 1 trigger: drop ≥ 15%                    |
| `window_min`   | 2 min     | Time window for Leg 1 after round start     |
| `fee_rate`     | 0.0       | Fee rate (e.g. for backtests)                |
| `market_id`    | (empty)   | Polymarket market/token ID (for live)        |
| `poll_interval`| 1 s       | How often to poll prices                     |

In `src/main.rs`, the simulation overrides some of these (e.g. `window_min = 5` minutes, `move_pct = 0.15`).

```

- **Exchange** — Abstraction over “get ticker” and “place order”. Mock implementation is used in the default run.
- **Market** — `PriceBuffer` keeps a short history of UP/DOWN prices and answers “price N seconds ago” for dump detection.
- **Strategy** — `Bot` holds config, exchange, buffers, and state; `run_tick()` runs one step of the strategy.

---

## Testing

```bash
cargo test
```

- **Market:** `PriceBuffer` — checks that “price X seconds ago” returns the expected value from the buffer.
- **Strategy:** Bot logic — with mock exchange, triggers a dump, expects Leg 1 then Leg 2 (state transitions to `Done`).

---

## Running Against Polymarket (Live)

The included **Polymarket client** (`src/exchange/polymarket.rs`) is a **stub**. A full implementation would:

- Call Polymarket CLOB REST API for order book (best bid/ask).
- Build and sign orders (EIP-712) with your key.
- Submit orders and handle fills.

To enable the stub and optional HTTP deps:

```bash
cargo run --release --features polymarket
```

Implementing real order placement and ticker fetching is left to you (e.g. using `reqwest` and an Ethereum signing library such as `ethers` or `alloy`).

---

## Features (Cargo)

- **default** — No network; mock exchange only. Safe for local simulation and tests.
- **polymarket** — Enables the Polymarket client stub and optional `reqwest`/`tokio` dependencies.
